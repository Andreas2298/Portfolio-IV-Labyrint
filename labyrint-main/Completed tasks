Tasks completed:

** The starting level has an empty slot in the surrounding wall. This slot should function as a door into the level called "aSharpPlace." Implement the door functionality so that the player can proceed to the next level.

** Create a new level (a third level) and link the unused door in "aSharpPlace" to exit into the new room.

** In "aSharpPlace," implement teleport functionality for the "♨︎" symbols. Entering one should move the player to the other.

** Ensure that when going back through a door, the player returns to the correct room.

** Create an animated splash screen (this was a group assignment from a previous week) using splashScreen.mjs.


•	Implement a simple battle system where collisions deal damage, using player and NPC stats to calculate damage dealt.

•	Output battle events to the event messages displayed beneath the map.

•	Create two new pickups: a health potion and poison, and include them in your level.
